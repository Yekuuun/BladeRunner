**Simple keylogger developped by my hand sending data through sockets to dedicated server keeping logs of clients. This project was fully developped in C++**

### Disclaimer ðŸš¨
This project was made only for learning purpose. I'm not responsible if you decide to use this code for malicious purpose. I developped it to learn by a practical case sockets & low level functions under WinAPI

---

### Compile client ?

`g++ -o client bladerunner.cpp -lws2_32`

### Warning 

For server side code, you have to chose a path to a valid folder who will keep the logs of the program in `server/src/server.cpp`

---

### What i've implemented ?

ðŸŸ¢ TCP connection between client - host

ðŸŸ¢ Sending Keylogger data to server

ðŸŸ¢ Keeping logs of received data
